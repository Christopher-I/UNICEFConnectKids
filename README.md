<h3 name="ScopeandOverview">Scope and Overview</h3>

    -Country: Nigeria.

    -Participants: The General Public / Donors, ISPs and Schools.

    -Sample size : 3 schools and 3 ISPs.

<h3 name="Assumptions">Assumptions</h3>

    - Payments to ISPs are in ETH/ERC20

    - Connectivity information such as upload/download speed is received via a solidity smart contract from ISPs and Schools.

    - An average mean upload /download speed and data size provision are sent every day from the schools and ISPs.

    - One ISP at a time is responsible for providing connectivity to all schools within a country(future iterations will allow multiple ISPs to manage different schools within a country).

    -ISPs and Schools apply to be part of the Dapp and are approved by an admin (to prevent spamming of the network and ensure all participants are real).

<h3 name="Additional Mechanisms">Additional Mechanisms</h3>

    -The current ISP provider is chosen by a bidding system via a smart contract based on quality of service it promises to provide( faster download/upload speeds) and its previous history of perfomance. This way the best service providers over time will have a bidding advantage.

    -ISP perfomance are graded at the end of an appriopriate cycle period(example 30 days) and payments are made after grading depending on ISP grade.

    -After every succesful grade at the end of cycle, ISP recieve 'consistency points' which are a positive factor when bidding for future ISP opportunities.

<h3 name="TechStackandTools">Tech Stack and Tools</h3>

    -Blockchain protocol - Ethereum(Rinkeby Network).

    -Front End - JavaScript, React, Html, CSS.

    -Back End - Solidity, Node.js, NextJs.

    -Other Libraries and Tools - ETH Timer, Truffle, Web3.
